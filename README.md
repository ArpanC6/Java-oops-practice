# Java OOPS Practice

This repository contains my step-by-step Java OOPS learning journey.
Each folder represents daily practice with clear concepts and examples.


## Day 01: Class, Object & Constructor

### Concepts Covered:
- What is a Class
- Object creation using `new`
- Constructor and its purpose
- Method definition and calling

### Example:
- Created a `Student` class
- Used constructor to initialize `name`, `roll`, and `marks`
- Used `display()` method to print student details

### Output:
Name, Roll, and Marks printed successfully.


## Day 02: Constructor Overloading & `this` Keyword

### Concepts Covered:
- Constructor overloading
- Using multiple constructors in a class
- Purpose of the `this` keyword
- Differentiating between instance variables and parameters

### Example:
- Created multiple constructors in the `Student` class
- Used `this` keyword to assign values to instance variables
- Demonstrated how different constructors are called based on arguments

### Key Learnings:
- Constructor name must be same as class name
- `this` refers to the current object
- Constructor overloading improves flexibility and readability

### Output:
Student details printed correctly using different constructors.
